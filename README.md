# Driver-Sleeping-Detection

# Objective:
This is a Driver's Drowsiness Detection System a Python Project made with the help of OpenCV which can automatically detect the driver's drowsiness and then plays an alarm and alert the driver if he appears to be drowsy.

# Description:
Approximately 20% of the road accidents occurs due to the drowsiness of the driver's. This is a serious problem as it is not only dangerous for the driver but also for the passengers travelling and people using the same road. To prevent all these complications we have build a system using Python and OpenCV which will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected. Drowsiness Detection System is a Safety and Security Technology which is developed in the vision to road accidents because of sleepiness and drowsiness of the driver.

# Advantages:
It can quickly detect drowsiness and can distinguish between normal and drowsy eyes.

# Applications:
Can be used by riders who tends to drive for a longer period of time and can also potentially save a lot of lives from accidents.
